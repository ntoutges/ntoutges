# PiCO Logic and Transistors

For me: programming serves double-duty as both a hobby and a job. I love taking any opportunity I can to learn more about the languages and algorithms that make the modern world work.

## Accomplishments

I have made far too many useless projects. Below is a small sample.

-   Custom [PiScript](https://github.com/ntoutges/PiScript) Esoteric Language

-   R(andom) Color: A serverless P2P web-based color picker: [rcolor](https://ntoutges.github.io/rcolor)

    -   Great for making a bunch of monitors flash the same color!

    -   (Synchronize by putting the 4-character code [at the bottom-right of the screen] into the URL search params); Ex: [https://ntoutges.github.io/rcolor?ABCD](https://ntoutges.github.io/rcolor?ABCD)

## Mathematics

I occasionally pretend to be a mathematician. As such, many of my programming projects revolve around some central mathematics concept.

-   [CPLANE](https://ntoutges.github.io/cplanes) A visualization of the classic problem about flying around the world with planes that can only hold (at most) half the fuel required for the journey.

    -   Note that this project features a custom lightweight language used for testing out multiple strategies (solutions are given below the language input).

-   [Name That Test](https://ntoutges.github.io/name-that-test) Created in about 5 hours to help study for the AP Statistics exam. The dataset used by this program was stolen wholecloth from [here](http://www.ltcconline.net/greenL/java/statistics/catstatprob/categorizingstatproblemsjavascript.html)!
    -   This site only exists because the lime green background of the original site was too painfoul for me to look at... And I was bored.
